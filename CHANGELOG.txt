Changelog
=========

1.3
[Features]
• Tracks now properly shuffle, unplayed tracks first then played tracks. Once all tracks are shuffled it will start again.
• Able to search by Spotify HTTP link in search bar

[Bug Fixes]
• Now saves track data in the database by querying the Spotify URI instead of using post data (post data is still used if the Spotify API is unavailable)
• No longer queries the spotify API for an empty string if the searchbox is left empty
• Only the tracklisting refreshes every 45 seconds instead of the entire page
• Several CSS bugs fixed (m.weston)
